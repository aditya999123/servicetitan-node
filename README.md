> **Unofficial.** This is a community-maintained Node.js/TypeScript client for the
> ServiceTitan API. It is not built, endorsed, or supported by ServiceTitan, Inc.

## Install

```
npm install servicetitan-node
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { ServiceTitan } from "servicetitan-node";

const st = new ServiceTitan({
  clientId: process.env.SERVICETITAN_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.SERVICETITAN_CLIENT_SECRET!,
  appKey: process.env.SERVICETITAN_APP_KEY!,
  tenantId: Number(process.env.SERVICETITAN_TENANT_ID),
  environment: "integration", // or "production"
});

const contact = await st.crm.contacts.get("abc-123");

const employees = await st.settings.employees.getList({ page: 1, pageSize: 50 });
```

## Examples

Runnable examples live under `examples/`, using the same `.env` credentials as
`npm run test:live`:

```
node --env-file-if-exists=.env examples/<name>.ts
```

- `list-and-get-employees.ts` — list employees, then fetch one individually by id.
- `paginate-all-employees.ts` — loop through every page of a list endpoint.
- `create-and-update-tag-type.ts` — create then update a resource. Mutates real data —
  refuses to run against production unless `SERVICETITAN_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_WRITES=true` is
  also set.
- `download-call-recording.ts` — consume a raw-response method, saving binary audio to a
  file. Requires `SERVICETITAN_EXAMPLE_CALL_ID` (a real call id with a recording).
- `handle-not-found-error.ts` — catch `ServiceTitanApiError` and branch on `.status`.

## Authentication

ServiceTitan's API uses OAuth 2.0 **client credentials** grant only (no per-user login).
`ServiceTitan` handles fetching and caching access tokens for you — tokens are cached and
automatically refreshed a safety margin before their 15-minute expiry, and concurrent calls
during a refresh share a single token request instead of firing duplicates. You provide:

- `clientId` / `clientSecret` — your registered application's credentials.
- `appKey` — sent as the `ST-App-Key` header on every request.
- `environment` — `"integration"` or `"production"` (defaults to `"production"`), each with
  its own auth and API endpoints.

See ServiceTitan's own [Getting Started docs](https://developer.servicetitan.io/docs/getting-started/oauth20)
for how to register an app and obtain these values.

### Tenant ID

`tenantId` is required when constructing `ServiceTitan` — a single instance always talks to
one tenant, and every generated method uses it automatically. You'll find your tenant ID in
the ServiceTitan UI (or wherever your integration's tenant list is managed); it's a numeric
id, not something the SDK can infer or default.

## Supported domains

`ServiceTitan` exposes all 24 ServiceTitan API domains as properties:

`accounting`, `crm`, `customerInteractions`, `dispatch`, `equipmentSystems`, `findings`,
`forms`, `inventory`, `jbce`, `jpm`, `marketing`, `marketingAds`, `marketingReputation`,
`memberships`, `payroll`, `pricebook`, `reporting`, `salestech`, `schedulingPro`,
`serviceAgreements`, `settings`, `taskManagement`, `telecom`, `timesheets`.

Each domain groups its operations by resource, e.g. `st.settings.employees.getList(query?)`,
`st.settings.employees.get(id)`, `st.settings.employees.create(body)`.

### Raw responses

A few operations return non-JSON bodies (binary audio downloads, or a variable content type
depending on the request) — these are still generated as real methods, but return the raw
`Response` object instead of a parsed body, since parsing assumes JSON. Consume the body
however fits:

```ts
const response = await st.telecom.calls.getRecording(456);
const audio = Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer());
```

### Escape hatch

For any endpoint not yet covered by generated code at all (e.g. a brand-new API before the
next `npm run generate`), use the underlying client directly — `st.client.request()` for a
JSON body, or `st.client.requestRaw()` for the raw `Response`. `st.client` is the same
`ServiceTitanClient` instance backing every domain property, so it shares the same cached
token.

## Development

Requires Node 24+ (the codebase runs TypeScript natively — no build step for tests).

```
npm test          # run all tests
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit across the whole project
npm run build     # bundle src/index.ts to dist/ (tsup, ESM + CJS + .d.ts)
npm run generate  # regenerate src/generated/ from specs/*.json
```

The OpenAPI specs under `specs/` are fetched from ServiceTitan's developer portal via
`npm run download-specs`; `npm run generate` turns them into the typed methods under
`src/generated/`. Generated files are committed to the repo and should never be edited by
hand — re-run the generator instead.
